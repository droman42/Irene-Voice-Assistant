## 11. MicroWakeWord Hugging Face Integration

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Component:** `irene/providers/voice_trigger/microwakeword.py`

### Problem

The MicroWakeWordProvider has been integrated with asset management but still needs Hugging Face model download support for seamless model distribution and updates.

### Current State

- ✅ Asset management integration completed
- ✅ Local model support with `url: "local"` configuration
- ✅ Legacy model path backward compatibility
- ❌ Hugging Face model download not implemented

### Required Implementation

1. **Hugging Face Integration**: Add support for downloading models from Hugging Face Hub
2. **Model Registry Updates**: Update `microwakeword` section in model registry with actual Hugging Face model URLs
3. **Download Validation**: Implement model validation and checksum verification
4. **Documentation**: Update configuration examples with Hugging Face model IDs

### Technical Details

**Asset Manager Changes:**
- Add Hugging Face URL pattern recognition in `_download_model_impl`
- Support `huggingface://organization/model-name` URL format
- Integrate with `huggingface_hub` library for downloads

**Configuration Updates:**
```yaml
microwakeword:
  irene_model:
    url: "huggingface://irene-ai/microwakeword-irene-v1"
    size: "5MB"
    format: "tflite"
    description: "Official microWakeWord model for 'irene'"
```

### Dependencies

- `huggingface_hub` library for model downloads

### Benefits
